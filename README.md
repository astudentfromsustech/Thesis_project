# Thesis_project: Dynamic 3D chromatin architecture of active and inactive regions and gene regulation of Drosophila under heat stress 
The genome is hierarchically organized into three-dimensional (3D) architecture and plays a very important role in the gene 
regulation in biological process and environmental stresses. Hi-C has been used to study how the 3D genome organization of 
Drosophila, which consists of active and inactive regions, responds to heat stress. However H3K27ac and H3K27me3 are mixed in Hi-C, 
here we apply in situ ChIA-PET to enrich H3K27ac and H3K27me3 separately, combined with the enrichment of RNAPII and RNA-seq data, 
to further explore how active and inactive regions are functionally changed in 3D chromatin architecture in response to heat stress. 
The study reveals the dynamic 3D structures at the levels of A/B compartments and TADs, along with their impact on gene regulation, 
in response to heat stress. Furthermore, it proposes a model for the dynamic 3D structures at the levels of A/B compartments under heat stress.
